- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R²
- Coefficient interpretation and regression line visualization

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Matplotlib / Seaborn 📈

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `cleaned_data.csv` – Preprocessed dataset
- `linear_regression_task3.ipynb` – Model training, evaluation, and plots
- `README.md` – Task description and summary

---

## 📊 Key Steps

1. Loaded the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`)
2. Selected relevant features (e.g., Age, Sex, Fare)
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Trained a `LinearRegression` model using `sklearn`
5. Printed model intercept & coefficients
6. Evaluated predictions using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
7. Visualized actual vs predicted values

## ✅ Results

- Model fitted and evaluated successfully
- Coefficients interpreted for each feature
- Regression output plotted and analyzed
- R² score used to measure prediction strength
